## BA Boost Java Assignments
### 1. Java 8 SE Features
It can be clearly seen that Java 8 has many new features such as programming language news, security options, network options, tools etc.
Based on my research, I would like to state some of them here. 

First of all one of the major changes on Java 8 SE is Base64 Encoding and Decoding. It's stated that on Oracle.com, this Java version comes with Unicode 6.2.0 support. 
I don't want to go deep inside Unicode 6.2.0, but this version is important for Turkish users. Because this version comes with a newly encoded Turkish lira sign.
And one more thing about Base64 encoding is when you encode text in ASCII, you start with a text string and convert it to a sequence of bytes. 
But when you encode data in Base64, you start with a sequence of bytes and convert it to a text string.

Another update on Java 8 is Lambda Expressions which is a new era (my opinion) for Java Developers. 
Lambda expressions are supported by method references and default methods which are new features too. 
Lambda expressions make code blocks shorter. Also they include parameters and return values. This means you can write shorter codes which do the same thing. 

A new method forEach() was provided by Java 8. ForEach() method (or loop) is a default method defined in the Iterable interface. 

### 2. Java 17 SE Features
After the release of JDK 9 on Sept. 2017, Oracle has started to release new version of JDK in every 6 months.
There are many improvements, fixes and features on JDK 17.

I would like to start with Sealed Classes. Sealed Classes are sealed classes by keywords to restrict the users from inheriting the class. 
These type of classes can not be extended and no class can be derived from a sealed class.
